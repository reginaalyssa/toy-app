# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## Toy Application

This is the second application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). It is a demo
application to develop a deeper understanding of Rails.
This project explores interaction through its URLs, the
RoR application structure, and the REST archivecture. It will
deal mainly with users and their microposts (i.e. similar with how
Twitter uses tweets, Facebook uses posts, YouTube uses videos).
