# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## Toy Application

This is the second application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). It covers Chapter 2 of the book/tutorial.
It is a demo application to develop a deeper understanding of Rails.
This project explores interaction through its URLs, the
RoR application structure, and the REST architecture. It will
deal mainly with users and their microposts (i.e. similar with how
Twitter users have tweets).
